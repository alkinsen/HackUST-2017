The idea is to reduce the traffic in crowded cities like Hong Kong. Our aim is to reduce the number of taxis or private cars by grouping up people who wants to the same location. However, carpooling causes even more traffic when the car collects everyone one by one.

Our app is called Unite and we minimize the total distance walked when pairing up the passengers while avoiding the congestions zones which were found using the data Uber provided during the hackathon. 

Ranked in the top 5 with our RideSharing app in the HackUST 2017
